## How to use this template
First of all, I am happy to help you by providing a starter pack for creating your own elementary OS applications! :kissing_heart:  
  
This template is available to everyone under the [GPL3 license](https://github.com/brombinmirko/ElementaryPython/blob/master/LICENSE), which means that you have to keep that license or change it with a compatible one.  

In order to promote the development of this project and respecting the license, it is correct and moral to [attribute third party code credits to the author](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/a/4582).  

Since your application can be an example for other users who intend to develop their own, you can ask [here](https://github.com/brombinmirko/ElementaryPython/issues) to list your application on this page.  

If you have any doubts or need help with development, do not hesitate to contact me :blush:
